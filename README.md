# My-Ubuntu-Server

All-in-one server with Apache2, MariaDB(SQL), PHP, TFTP, DHCP, Targetcli(iSCSI), PXE, iPXE

It's just an archive commands, i used to make my server, when was released Ubuntu 18.04.
I found them in my archived folder.
This server works perfect and, i believe, it will be helpful for me and other people in the past.

For understanding:
Wi-Fi Router have default ip 192.168.0.1
Wi-Fi Router DHCP 192.168.0.50 - 192.168.0.149
Server ip 192.168.150
Server DHCP 192.168.0.151 - 192.168.0.199

Yes, it's far far from ideal... But it was my real server.
