# My-Ubuntu-Server

All-in-one server with Apache2, MariaDB(SQL), PHP, TFTP, DHCP, Targetcli(iSCSI)

It's just an archive commands, i used to make my server, when was released Ubuntu 18.04.
I found them in my archived folder.
This server works perfect and, i believe, it will be helpful for me and other people in the past.
