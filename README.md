# My-Ubuntu-Server

<p>All-in-one server with Apache2, MariaDB(SQL), PHP, TFTP, DHCP, SAMBA, Targetcli(iSCSI), PXE, iPXE
<p>
<p>It's just an archive commands, i used to make my server, when was released Ubuntu 18.04.
<p>I found them in my archived folder.
<p>This server works perfect and, i believe, it will be helpful for me and other people in the past.
<p>
<p>For understanding:
<p>Wi-Fi Router have default ip 192.168.0.1
<p>Wi-Fi Router DHCP 192.168.0.50 - 192.168.0.149
<p>Server ip 192.168.150
<p>Server DHCP 192.168.0.151 - 192.168.0.199
<p>
<p>Yes, it's far far from ideal... But it was my first real server.
